Short abstract:  
Change in species composition over time is the result of both interannual variability and directional change, but their relative importance can be clouded by pseudoturnover. We developed a matrix decomposition approach based on yearly resolved vegetation-plot time-series to disentangle these effects and showed that ignoring pseudoturnover could result in a substantial overestimation of interannual variability.
